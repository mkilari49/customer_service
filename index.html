      <h2>Customer Service Standards Statement</h2>
      <p>
        As an IT Supervisor, I believe every end-user deserves to be treated with patience, empathy, and respect.
        Technology should empower users, not frustrate them, and my goal is to make IT a positive, enabling
        experience.<br><br>

        <strong>How IT Should Treat End Users:</strong><br>
        - With respect and clear communication<br>
        - By listening actively and validating concerns<br>
        - Providing timely, accurate solutions without blame<br><br>

        <strong>Great Service Means:</strong><br>
        - Fast, friendly, and reliable assistance<br>
        - Proactive rather than reactive support<br>
        - Consistent follow-up<br><br>

        <strong>Complaint Resolution:</strong><br>
        - Stay calm and composed<br>
        - Apologize sincerely<br>
        - Investigate thoroughly<br>
        - Communicate timelines<br>
        - Follow up to confirm resolution

      <h2>Escalation Flowchart</h2>
      <p>
        The escalation flowchart outlines the structured process followed when a customer service or technical issue
        cannot be resolved at the first level of support. It clearly defines the decision points, responsible teams, and
        communication channels involved in escalating a case to higher support tiers (Tier 2 or Tier 3), management, or
        specialized departments. This ensures timely resolution, accountability, and a consistent customer experience
        across all service requests.

    <!-- Sample Helpdesk Response -->
    <section>
      <h2>Sample Helpdesk Ticket Response</h2>
      <p>The user reached out due to issues with accessing their email. After verifying the situation, it was identified
        that the problem stemmed from a recent server update. The issue has been escalated to the Tier 2 support team,
        and a resolution is expected within the next two hours. As a temporary workaround, the user has been advised to
        access their email via the web portal. Ongoing updates will be provided to the user, and support will remain
        available should further assistance be required.</p>
